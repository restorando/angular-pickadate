### Demo

### Installation

1) Add the `pickadate` module to your dependencies

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['pickadate']);
```

2) Use the `pickadate` directive in any element

```html
<div pickadate ng-model="date"></div>
```

Pickadate is fluid, so it will take the width of the parent container.

### Pickadate options

The `pickadate` directive can be passed an object with options set on it. This is optional. The following are the options available (with their default values):

```javascript
{
    clickThroughMonths: false
}
```

`clickThroughMonths` - allow for selection of dates outside the current month, which if selected will navigate you to that month.

#### min-date, max-date

```html
<div pickadate ng-model="date" min-date="minDate" max-date="maxDate"></div>
```

```javascript
function MyAppController($scope) {
    $scope.minDate = '2013-11-10';
    $scope.maxDate = '2013-12-31';
}
```

`min-date` and `max-date` take angular expressions, so if you want to specify the values inline, don't forget the quotes!

```html
<div pickadate ng-model="date" min-date="'2013-11-10'" max-date="'2013-12-31'"></div>
```

Changes to min/max dates aren't reflected until the next month change. See *display-month* below.

#### disabled-dates

```html
<div pickadate ng-model="date" disabled-dates="disabledDates"></div>
```

```javascript
function MyAppController($scope) {
    $scope.disabledDates = ['2013-11-10', '2013-11-15', '2013-11-19'];
}
```

Changes to disabled dates aren't reflected until the next month change. See *display-month* below.

#### display-month

Allows you to (pre)set the calendar to a particular month without setting the chosen date.

```html
<div pickadate display-month="presetDate"></div>
```

```javascript
function MyAppController($scope) {
    $scope.presetDate = '2013-12-01';
}
```

#### week-starts-on

Sets the first day of the week. The default is 0 for Sunday.

```html
<div pickadate week-starts-on="1"></div>
```

#### no-extra-rows

The calendar will have between 4 and 6 rows if this attribute is present. By default it will always have 6 rows.

```html
<div pickadate no-extra-rows></div>
```

### I18n

Pickadate uses angular `$locale` module for the date translations. If you want to have the calendar in any other language, please include the corresponding AngularJS i18n files. You can get them here: [http://code.angularjs.org/1.2.0-rc.2/i18n/](http://code.angularjs.org/1.2.0-rc.2/i18n/).

For the remaining translations you can configure the `pickadateI18nProvider`.

```javascript
angular.module('testApp', ['pickadate'])

    .config(function(pickadateI18nProvider) {
        pickadateI18nProvider.translations = {
            prev: 'ant',
            next: 'sig'
        }
    });
```

### Future development

Currently `pickadate` only works as an inline datepicker, but would like it to make it work in any text input as an overlay like the `jquery-ui` one. Will be happy to merge your pull requests.
